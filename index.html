    <h2>Your Scratch Pad</h2>
    
    <p>Jot down quick drafts whenever inspiration strikes. The first few words are always the hardest to write. Ponder is a ten file scratch pad that works in your web browser. It's designed to mimic the simplicity and distraction free writing experience of electronic word processors from the past.</p>

    <h2>Private and Offline</h2>

    <p>Ponder is private. Although it runs in your browser it was designed to work completely offline. Documents are stored in your local browser storage and are not transmitted to a central server.</p>

    <h2>You Own It</h2>

    <p>When you buy Ponder, you get a perpetual license for the current version and a download that you can run from your own computer. You also support the author so that I can create Ponder improvements and other great software.</p>
